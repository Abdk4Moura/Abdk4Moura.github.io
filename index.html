                <p>“Technical mastery is most beautiful when it meets human problems.”</p>
                <p>I care deeply about clarity, correctness, and the craft of engineering. Each project I work on is an exploration — not just of technology, but of thought itself.</p>

            <div class="philosophy-content">
                <p>As a researcher, I focus on advancing software engineering through rigorous exploration of programming languages and systems. My work spans functional programming with Haskell for type-safe, composable systems; systems programming using Rust and Go for high-performance, concurrent applications; scientific computing with Python for data analysis and simulations; and web technologies with TypeScript for scalable distributed systems.</p>
                <p>I'm passionate about bridging theoretical computer science with practical engineering, contributing to open-source projects and academic collaborations.</p>
